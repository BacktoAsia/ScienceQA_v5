Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.\nBush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.\nClimbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg.

Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. \nBecause there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen \/ number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff.

To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n","solution":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with straight ears or curled ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for curled ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for straight ears.\nStraight ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. An American curl cat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with straight ears must have the genotype ee.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.\nCurled ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. An American curl cat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with curled ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with straight ears to offspring with curled ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with straight ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with curled ears."},"14985":{"question":"Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n","solution":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with pale orange cheeks or bright orange cheeks, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the cheek color trait. The question tells you that the r allele, which is for pale orange cheeks, is recessive to the R allele, which is for bright orange cheeks.\nPale orange cheeks is the recessive allele's version of the cheek color trait. A cockatiel with the recessive version of the cheek color trait must have only recessive alleles for the cheek color gene.

This box is highlighted below.\nBright orange cheeks is the dominant allele's version of the cheek color trait. A cockatiel with the dominant version of the cheek color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the cheek color gene. So, offspring with bright orange cheeks must have the genotype RR or Rr.\nThere are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype RR or Rr. These boxes are highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with pale orange cheeks to offspring with bright orange cheeks is 1:3.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce.

To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

The question tells you that the f allele, which is for smooth fruit, is recessive to the F allele, which is for bumpy fruit.\nSmooth fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait.

These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen \/ number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen \/ number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff \/ total number of boxes = 1 \/ 4.","solution":""},"175":{"question":"Select the chemical formula for this molecule.","choices":["H2F","H2F2","HF","HF2"],"answer":2,"hint":"","image":"\/Users\/shuogudaojin\/ScienceQA\/image\/175\/image.png","task":"closed choice","grade":"grade7","subject":"natural science","topic":"chemistry","category":"Atoms and molecules","skill":"Identify chemical formulas for ball-and-stick models","lecture":"Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.\nScientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.\nA ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.\nThe balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.\nEvery element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.\nThe molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.\nThe chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.\nSo, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above.","solution":"H is the symbol for hydrogen. According to the legend, hydrogen atoms are shown in light gray. F is the symbol for fluorine. According to the legend, fluorine atoms are shown in light green. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one hydrogen atom and one fluorine atom. The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and F. There is one hydrogen atom, so H will not have a subscript. There is one fluorine atom, so F will not have a subscript. The correct formula is HF.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n","solution":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with mirror scales or normal scales, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the scale type trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for normal scales, is dominant over the a allele, which is for mirror scales.\nMirror scales is the recessive allele's version of the scale type trait. A common carp with the recessive version of the scale type trait must have only recessive alleles for the scale type gene.

A common carp with the dominant version of the scale type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the scale type gene. So, offspring with normal scales must have the genotype AA or Aa.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with mirror scales to offspring with normal scales is 4:0.

One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?","solution":""},"6686":{"question":"Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n","solution":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with an unspotted tail or a spotted tail, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the tail spots trait. The question tells you that the I allele, which is for a spotted tail, is dominant over the i allele, which is for an unspotted tail.\nAn unspotted tail is the recessive allele's version of the tail spots trait. A guppy with the recessive version of the tail spots trait must have only recessive alleles for the tail spots gene. So, offspring with an unspotted tail must have the genotype ii.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ii.\nA spotted tail is the dominant allele's version of the tail spots trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the tail spots trait must have at least one dominant allele for the tail spots gene. So, offspring with a spotted tail must have the genotype II or Ii.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype II or Ii.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with an unspotted tail to offspring with a spotted tail is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with an unspotted tail. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a spotted tail."},"5131":{"question":"What is the name of the colony shown?","choices":["Rhode Island","Ohio","New Hampshire","Vermont"],"answer":2,"hint":"","image":"\/Users\/shuogudaojin\/ScienceQA\/image\/5131\/image.png","task":"closed choice","grade":"grade4","subject":"social science","topic":"us-history","category":"English colonies in North America","skill":"Identify the Thirteen Colonies","lecture":"","solution":"The colony is New Hampshire.\nDuring the colonial era, New Hampshire and New York both claimed the territory that would later become the state of Vermont.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive.

The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration.

The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.\nEvery element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter.

The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n","solution":"A blue jay's scientific name is Cyanocitta cristata. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta.\nCyanocitta stelleri is in the genus Cyanocitta. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta. So, Cyanocitta stelleri and Cyanocitta cristata are in the same genus.\nStrix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Cyanocitta cristata are not in the same genus.\nStrix nebulosa is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix.

Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.","solution":"Look at the picture of the scarlet macaw.\nThe scarlet macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The scarlet macaw uses its thick beak to crack the shell of a nut by squeezing it. The hooked shape of the beak can help the bird hold the nut in place while cracking it.\nNow look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.\nThe African gray parrot has a thick hooked beak.

They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.\nThe sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.\nThe fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.\nWhen the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again.","solution":"A sperm and an egg can fuse to form a fertilized egg.
